        <p> In the process of managing a fishery for sustainability, determining who will be granted access, and how that access will be distributed are decisions that carry significant social, cultural and economic implications. Traditionally, these allocation decisions have been made based on participants’ historical catch levels, or their historical access to the area in question. However, these traditional allocation approaches may not be appropriate in all contexts because they 1) may not address existing problems in the fishery (e.g., historically marginalized groups not receiving a fair share of the benefits flowing from the fishery), or 2) they may result in unintended consequences that are out of alignment with the goals and values of the fishing community (e.g., market forces leading to a reduction in diversity of fishing techniques and targets and potentially eliminating cultural value of the fishery).

<br> Through research, expert interviews and a design workshop, we have developed a variety of potential allocation approaches intended to help avoid or address a number of challenges often associated with traditional allocation methods, and to meet specific social, cultural, economic, and/or conservation goals set by fishing community stakeholders. You can explore this database of allocation approaches through either of these lenses: sorting by the allocation-relevant challenges your fishery faces, or by the allocation-relevant goals your stakeholders hope to achieve. </p>
